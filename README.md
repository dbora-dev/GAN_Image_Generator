Generative adversarial networks (GAN)
GAN-MNIST-Handwritten-Digits
This repository contains the code and resources for a project that uses Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate new images of handwritten digits. The GAN model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which consists of real images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to explore the capabilities of GANs in generating realistic images. By training the model on the MNIST dataset, we aim to generate new, unique images of handwritten digits that are indistinguishable from the real ones.

Model Description
The GAN model consists of two main components: a generator and a discriminator. The generator creates new images from random noise, while the discriminator evaluates the authenticity of the generated images against the real ones from the MNIST dataset. Through this adversarial process, the generator learns to produce more realistic images over time.

Results
The results of this project demonstrate the power of GANs in generating realistic images. The generated images of handwritten digits closely resemble the real ones in the MNIST dataset, showcasing the potential of GANs in various applications such as data augmentation, anomaly detection, and more.
